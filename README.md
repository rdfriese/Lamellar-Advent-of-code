Solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles using the [Lamellar](https://crates.io/crates/lamellar) Runtime.

For most these problems, there appears to exist an efficient serial implementation, limiting the benefit of a parallel (and distributed) runtime.
Still, this is an effort to explore Lamellar and provide some examples on how to use the runtime!

Generally, I will implement a serial solution as well as at least one Lamellar based solution.
